# Project: Members Only

In this project, I build an Blog Post App where your members can write anonymous posts. If logged-in, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

### Clone the project

- Clone the repo and run the app.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/M-Alamgir/members-only.git
$ cd members-only

```

### Run bundle install and migrate as follows:

```bash
bundle install

rails db:migrate
```

### Run the rails console

```bash
rails console

```

## Creating a new User

``` bash

> user = User.new(name: "Mark", email: "Mark@email.com", password: "password")
> user.authenticate("wrongpassword")
=> false
> user.authenticate("password")
=> #<User id: nil, name: "Mark", email: "Mark@email.com", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil, password_digest: [FILTERED]>

```
